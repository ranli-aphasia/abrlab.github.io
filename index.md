# About us

The Aphasia and Brain Recovery (ABR) Lab is directed by Dr. Ran Li at Hong Kong Baptist University. A brain injury can tremendously impact someone's language abilities, causing aphasia. We take both behavioral and neuroimaging approaches to establish effective language therapies for these people, and to understand how the brain rewires as a result of language therapy.

If you are would like to participating in our research, please directly [email](mailto:ranli92@hkbu.edu.hk) us.

The primary goal of our research is to investigate both the behavioral and neural evidence of language treatment in people with aphasia.

Currently, we use behavioral measurements and fMRI to understand patterns of bilingual language recovery in Hong Kong Chinese-English bilinguals with aphasia. We developed different treatment programs that aim to improve a variety of language abilities, including word-retrieval ability, morphological processing, reading, and sentence production.
